<p class="articletext">Welcome. This interface allows you to navigate the text of Shakespeare's plays, as digitized and marked up by Folger.</p>

<p class="articletext">It guides you through the plays by interesting pathways:
<ul class="articletext">
<li>It picks a play at random.</li>
<li>You read the play, or search for a passage with CTRL+F in your browser.</li>
<li>Click on a passage you like.</li>
<li>It calls up matched passages.</li>
<li>If you click on the ~score line~ it will show you JSTOR articles that made this match between passages.</li>
<li>If you click on the text of a matched passage, it will become your new selection on the left, and new suggested matches will be made in the middle.</li>
<li>If you like the selection and matches you have found, you can save this by clicking on the link above, and sharing that URL.</li>
<li>You can always start over.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p class="articletext">How does it make these suggestions of matched passages? It doesn't, really. These suggestions were made by Shakespeare scholars and other writers over the last 500 years. This machine just counts them up. You will find keyword matches, yes, but the machine doesn't actually look at the keywords. It looks at matches that writers have made implicitly, by reading -- and really the only way to understand these matches is to read them :)</p>
